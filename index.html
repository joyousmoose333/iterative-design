          <h5 class="card-title">Motivation</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Welcome to our iterative design journey! Considering the importance of iterating through
            multiple rounds of design, critique and testing in product development, we formed a team to go through a
            typical design workflow of a startup's product--in this case, an online Manga subscription service called
            Azuki. We challenged ourselves to design a prototype for Azuki's site without looking at the startup's
            current product. Here we describe our process from sketching to user testing.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">The Startup</h5>
          <p class="card-text">We chose to design a desktop prototype for <a href="https://www.azuki.co/">Azuki</a>, a
          startup that provides digitally licensed manga online in a subscription-based model! Azuki received funding in
          Y Combinator's Winter 2022 round, and has been active since. For more info, see 
          <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/azuki">Azuki's YC page</a>.</p>

          <p class="card-text">We began by brainstorming multiple possible interface designs for our site. Below are our
            initial rough sketches. These represent a variety of layouts that we then workshopped and discussed to decide
            on a final design.</p>

          <p class="card-text">After deciding on a final design, we created wireframes to represent the layout of our
            site. We used Figma to create our wireframes to allow for real-time collaboration. Below are our wireframes.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Initial Mockup</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Next, we proceeded to translate our wireframes into a HiFi, interactive mockup using Figma.
            Here, we made our major design choices for color, content, and hierarchy to build a usable mockup. 
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Initial Design Choices</h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            <ul>
              <li> Combined best practices from our different designs (Netflix-like home page, top-of-screen navigation
                bar, etc.)</li>
              <li> Used a color scheme and font that is easy on the eyes and easy to read with high contrast
                <li>Orange and blue for elements</li>
                <li>Black or off-white font depending on background</li>
                <li>Off-white background for high-contrast without straining eyes</li>
              </li>
              <li> Made the site as simple as possible, with a minimalistic design</li>
              <li> Made the site as intuitive as possible, with clear and consistent labeling, and interactive elements
                with common affordances (e.g. downward arrow for navigation bar dropdown)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="card" id="critique">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Critique & Final Mockup</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Following the methodology of a traditional iterative design process, we participated in a
            critique session where we received feedback on our mockup. Listed below are the points of feedback we received
            and took into consideration when designing the second iteration of our mockup.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Feedback</h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            <ul>
              <li>Change color of social media icons to blend in with the design of the rest of our site</li>
              <li>Make "My Library" dropdown open with click on every page that includes my library in the header.</li>
              <li>Make titles of categories on home page more noticeable (more spacing, different text styling for visual hierarchy)</li>
              <li>Include a way to return back to title page after opening a book page</li>
              <li>Provide an indication of how search results were sorted</li>
              <li>Have phone number and email links</li>
              <li>Make search results and home page less similar</li>
              <li>Include chapter guide in case a user does not want to start at the beginning</li>
              <li>Check for continuity of capitalization (lowercase aesthetic <3)</li>
            </ul>

          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Final Mockup</h6>

          <p class="card-text">We used a remote usability test to collect feedback from three users on our mockup. To setup the user test, we provided task 
            instructions and post-test questions so that the users could provide us with useful feedback.

          <h5 class="card-title">Overall Analysis of User Testing</h5>
          <p class="card-text">We expected that all of the tasks were going to be successfully completed, as the tasks we wrote represented the flow and functionality we attempted to build out in our prototype. Most of our tasks were successfully completed by all three testers and most of the difficulty and confusion came from the fact that our prototype is not 100% interactable and functional. All of these results matched our expectations and it was useful to see those expectations met by users who were outside of our team.     
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Changes we would make given this feedback:</h6>
          <p>Given this feedback, we would create much clearer navigation between pages (especially if we were to build out our HiFi into a real site), specifically with more clear “back” functionality and clearer methods for learnability. Maybe a pop-up to explain the page-flip functionality upon first use would be useful.

We gained further experience with prototyping, user testing, and aligning the mission of a product to our interface.
